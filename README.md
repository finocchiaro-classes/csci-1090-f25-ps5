# Problem Set 6

How you submit your problem sets will be a little bit different now. You will be doing your work in a Colab notebook. These instructions below will be included in each notebook, but here's a summary:

1. You will follow the instructions in [the Colab notebook for PS6](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LkEnXfGb9tlONWgWkgSXcCS3tCveoSo5?usp=sharing) to create your own copy of the notebook.
2. You will edit the Colab notebook to complete the various tasks, as indicated in the notebook. Most of the time this will involve writing code in a code cell, but sometimes you will answer questions in a text cell. It will always be clear what you have to do.
3. When your notebook is complete, you will share the notebook with me and the TAs, as decribed in the notebook.
4. You will download your Colab notebook to your computer, move it into this repository, and add, commit, and push it to GitHub, just like you have done for previous problem sets.
5. You will *not* alter the Colab notebook after the deadline. If you do -- even just to fix a typo! -- it will look like you turned the notebook in late.

I will post a copy of my Colab notebook from class, which has lots of examples answering the same kinds of questions and using all the necssary functions. 


**Remember** I now expect you to write comments in your code! One point will be deducted if you do not provide comments explaining your code. Here's what I would like commented this time:

* Before every function, describe what it does and what its arguments are. Exception: you do not need to explain what `main()` is for.
* Before every variable, explain what value it is holding. Exception: variables that appear after the keyword `for`.
* **NEW** Insert a blank line before each comment. See my sample code for examples.
* **NEW** Insert line breaks in comments to make them readable without horizontal scrolling. See my sample code for examples.

**Remember** Now at the top of every file, you will include your honor pledge. The first four lines (comments) of every Python file should be this information. I'll give you a space in the Colab notebook for you to write your pledge.

## Deliverables

This problem set is due **Monday, October 21, 11:59pm EDT**. Remember this is how you submit:

1. Share your Colab notebook with me and the TAs, as decribed in the notebook.
2. Download the notebook to your computer, move it to this repository, and add, commit, and push it, just as you did for Python files in your previous problem sets.
